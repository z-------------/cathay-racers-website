                        As the Team Manager, I organise the team and ensure that all tasks are complete. The role of organising meetings, time plans, and ensuring that each member has a task to complete falls to me. Additionally, I am responsible for checking and authorising items produced by the team to ensure it is of the best quality. I think I am well suited for the role of team manager due to my keen determination, self-confidence, and organisational abilities. This role also gives me the opportunity to further practice and improve these valuable skills.

                        As the Visual Identity Director of the team, I am responsible for the team's visual identity including logos, pit displays, uniforms and so on. Also, I am the team manager of the Chinese side of the team so it is also my responsibility to make sure everything is in progress. I consider myself suited to these jobs because of my leadership skills and sense of responsibility inside me, as well as my talent in designing and  skills in manipulating software such as Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and InDesign.

                        Being the Design Engineer, I am responsible for designing both the shape and its structure in order to remain the competence of our team. I need to pay attention to every detail of the design since every subtle difference can affect the whole aerodynamic configuration. Close cooperation with the engineer is also indispensable. In years past, the dream of speed has survived, so I hope that I can create a well-designed car for the F1 in Schools World Finals. I am confident about making the car with my team due to the effort I made in exploring aerodynamics.

                        As the Manufacturing Engineer of the team, my job is to manufacture the car based on the 3D model which was created by our Aerodynamic Engineer. To make our car as fast as possible, I will try every possible way and carry out a series of experiments in order to reduce friction.

                        As Marketing Director, it is my duty to focus on finding sponsorship opportunities for the team, contact these potential sponsors, set up meetings, and stay in contact with the sponsors to see the sponsorship go through to its fullest. I also share roles with the communications director in maintaining and updating the team social media accounts. I feel that I am best suited for this role because I am a fairly outgoing person who is not afraid to meet new people and face new challenges.

                        F1 in Schools is an international competition set out to provide an amazing but very challenging educational experience through the magnetic appeal of Formula One. The competition is the only global multi-disciplinary challenge for students aged 9-19 and is now recognized as the world's largest STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) competition.
                    p.
                        Students work in teams of between 3 and 6, each taking on an assigned role that fulfils the necessary components of the competition.

                    p.
                        The competition will involve (among other things) acquiring resources and equipment that we need to achieve our goal.
                    p Some of the things that need to be funded:
                    ul
                        li car resources and materials
                        li team display

                    p.
                        We would be very grateful if you would consider sponsoring us, six students from Hong Kong and China, and help us to succeed in our quest for success in F1 in Schools.
